1.) You work at an e-commerce company that sells three goods: widgets, doodads, and fizzbangs. The head of advertising asks you which they should feature in their new advertising campaign. You have data on individual visitors' sessions (activity on a website, pageviews, and purchases), as well as whether or not those users converted from an advertisement for that session. You also have the cost and price information for the goods.

    To find out which good I would feature in an advertisement, I would first try to find out which good had the most conversions from
    an advertisement.  Then I would find demographic data on who are the persons that converted from an advertisement.  Next I would 
    create statistical tests that would ensure that the demographic data are significant variables that predict whether a customer would 
    convert based on an advertisement.  After that, I would create a model that would predict whether a customer would convert.  Then I would 
    test my model on samples of our customer population.  If the results were significant I would report them to the head of
    advertising and provide recommendations on how to conduct the campaign.  If the test results were not significant I would redo my
    analysis or model.
    
2.) You work at a web design company that offers to build websites for clients. Signups have slowed, and you are tasked with finding out why. The onboarding funnel has three steps: email and password signup, plan choice, and payment. On a user level you have information on what steps they have completed as well as timestamps for all of those events for the past 3 years. You also have information on marketing spend on a weekly level.

    First, I would find out if there is a correlation between the slowing of the signups and the time spent on each step of the sign-up
    process.  I would also find out if there is a correlation between the marketing spend of the week.  Also, I would find out the trend of the
    time at each step of the sign-up process.  I would then conduct statistical tests to see if there are differences in the times in each 
    year.  
    
3.) You work at a hotel website and currently the website ranks search results by price. For simplicity's sake, let's say it's a website for one city with 100 hotels. You are tasked with proposing a better ranking system. You have session information, price information for the hotels, and whether each hotel is currently available.

    First, I would find out what are the top 10 booked hotels.  Next, I would find the average cost of the hotel booked.  The ranking system 
    would rank by the cheapest hotel and then it would be ranked by hotel's number of bookings.
    
4.) You work at a social network, and the management is worried about churn (users stopping using the product). You are tasked with finding out if their churn is atypical. You have three years of data for users with an entry for every time they've logged in, including the timestamp and length of session

    I would first ask them to define the time period that contains their worrying churn rate.  If the time period is defined as a year.  I would
    create statistical test to see if each year's mean churn rate are significantly different.  If the time period is a month.  I would create a
    statistical test to see if each month's mean churn rate significantly different.
