Read the following descriptions of an experiment and its analysis, identify the flaws in each, and describe what you would do to correct them.

1.) The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.

    One flaw in the study is that each slogan was delivered by a different Sith lord.  Both Sith Lords should have delivered both
    slogans, because there might be bias depending on who delivers the slogan.  Also, it is quite possible the there is difference
    on the delivery of the slogan.  Differences in slogan performance must be accounted for or neutralized in testing for the 
    preference of a new Sith slogan.
    
2.) In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.

    If Jar Jar Binks went only to the four friendly planets and Mace Windu only went to the four unfriendly planets then the findings 
    are biased.  There is a greater chance that a planet will be receptive if they are considered more friendly.  On the other hand,
    there is a lesser chance that a planet will be receptive if they are considered to be unfriendly.  Jar Jar Binks should have visited
    planets that are split evenly betweeen friendly and unfriendly.  The same should apply for Mace Windu.  Also the degree of 
    friendliness and unfriendliness of the planets should be equal between Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu.  
    
3.) A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction for HR and for IT and present the report.

    There might be an occurrence of the Simpson's paradox related to the satisfaction rates for the Human Resources workers.  The overall
    satisfaction score for HR workers might not accurately reflect the Human Resources workers for the two countries where there isn't a 
    concentration of HR workers.  I think it is important to display the satisfaction score by country and the size of the country's
    HR department.
    
4.) When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to "opt in" to a data collection scheme where their level of physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.

    It is possible that the people at the application are only looking at the people you have "opted in".  They are not looking at or
    do not have access to the data of the people who are using the app but did not "opt in".  So, if they are claiming that there is
    a steady rise in activity of people who have downloaded the app they must preface their statement saying that the data is only 
    based on users who have decided to "opt in" for data collection.
    
5.) To prevent cheating, a teacher writes three versions of a test. She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A, then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.

    There is an error in the study, as the teacher grouped the test versions together.  It is possible that a certain demographic of her
    students only took that one version of the test, and that demographic is not representative of the population as a whole.  I would 
    create samples that pooled equally from the classes.  I would also check that the grade distribution of the samples where consistent
    between samples and then I would assign a version of the test to each sample.
