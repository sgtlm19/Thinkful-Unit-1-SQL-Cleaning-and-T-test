For each of the following scenarios, call out the potential biases in the proposed experiment.

1.) You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.

    There is bias in this method.  People will not be receptive to the advertising emails in February as it is peak winter and 
    people will most likely not be interested in getting bathing suits.  Also, people will be extremely receptive to the 
    advertisiing emails in May as it is late spring and people will be interested in getting swimsuits.

2.) You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population

    There is bias in this study.  People who are anxious will be...anxious and they are most likely going to search for a clinic
    to treat what ever makes them anxious.
    
3.) You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week

    There is bias in this method.  The first week will most likely show an increase in website visits but that time is very short.
    A longer period of measurement is needed to effectively measure the new ad billboard campaign effects.
    
4.) You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.

    There is bias in this method.  The first week will most likely not show any effects for a loyalty program.  Typically a loyalty
    program requires a record of continuous visits or actions for a customer to receive an incentive.  A longer period of 
    measurement is needed to effectively measure the new loyalty program.
