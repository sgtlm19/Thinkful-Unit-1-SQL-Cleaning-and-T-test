Look back to the potential experiments in the previous assignment. For one of those experiments, write up the essential points of an RFC for an improved version of that experiment.

1.) A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction for HR and for IT and present the report

    Objective - The objective of the experiment is to see the overall satisfaction score of the HR and IT workers across the company.
    Studies have shown that a below average work satisfaction score will lead to constant turnover.  This constant turnover will make
    it difficult for the company maintain projects and to keep valuable talent.  It is also important to gauge the the work satisfaction
    score of the employees as it will show how well the work environment is operating.  
    
    Hypothesis - By attaining an accurate, significant work satisfaction score we will be able to determine whether or not 
    money/effort needs to be spent to improve the work satisfaction among employees.
    
    Method of Testing - The method of testing that will be implemented is that we will use the annual company surveys if they are
    viable.  If they are not viable, we will conduct survey.  In the survey we will make sure the results of the survey will be analyzed
    by the various demographics of the employee: age, time-at-company, salary etc.  
    
    Coverage - There is data covered by the annual work surveys but we will need to ensure that the questions on the survey are valid
    questions that solicit an accurate truthful response.  We will need to see if the amount of people who reply to the survey is 
    enough to provide significant insight for the population.  
    
    Reliability - We will have to see the past work satifaction surveys and see if the scores are consistent.  
    
    Correlation - On the face of it, the results of the annual work satisfaction survey can be correlated to the work satisfaction 
    score. 
    
    Volatility - The data should not be volatile as long as the data gathered is at a neutral time for the company where there are
    no significant events that might skew the data to a certain end of a spectrum.  
    
    Execution - The tools and the methods used to gather the work satisfaction score might not be appropriate and must be validated.
    Scope creep will not be anticipated.
